1 - how to store passwords in dataBase (string or binary) using bcrypt and with what length
    and are these lengths a business logic or have standards 
    
2 - orm usage and configurations (see and check which method is more accurate + my chat)

3 - check the friendship table 

4 - centralized associations or associations in each file?

5 - I removed likeId, is it okay ?

6 - can I define the foreign keys inside that model to increase readability ?
    and put associations in a separate files to get the methods ?

7 - ask about where the sync and associations are put

8 - does this imports create an overload on the system

9 - do i need to use the built in association functions or if it's easier can i directly put the foriegn key myself

10 - when do we clean sessions table

11 -static async updatePost(postContent, postId, userId){
        const result = await PostModel.updatePost(postContent, postId, userId);

        if (result === 0) {
            throw new Error('Post not updated, either post id is invalid or you are not the owner of the post');
            // not authorized 
        }
        console.log("inside update Post",post)
        return await PostModel.getPostById(postId);
    }
    better error message or approach?

    ---------------------

-> how to create from models files 
migrations in database (check it out)
how to call associations from the same class ?  (check gitup if stuck)


DO:
    define foriegn keys directly in Tables
    migrations in database (check it out) try to change a column name
    with every action check token and session, bothhh
    put docker container and make requests to the docker container (locally)
